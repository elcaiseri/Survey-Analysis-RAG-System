# Evaluating AI Search Visibility for Chime

## Project Description
Assess Chime’s visibility and discoverability on AI search platforms and Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to competitors: Ally Bank, Varo, Capital One, and SoFi Bank. The task involves designing and implementing a framework to evaluate each brand’s presence and relevance on selected AI platforms.

The project consists of:

- **Backend:** A FastAPI-based service that processes user queries and interacts with the OpenAI API.
- **Frontend:** A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface served using Nginx.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Both backend and frontend are containerized for easy deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Features

- **Interactive Query Interface:** Users can ask questions about the survey datasets in natural language.
- **AI-Generated Insights:** Retrieves precise answers using OpenAI’s models.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, intuitive UI for easy interaction.
- **Dockerized Setup:** Simple container-based deployment with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Install Docker.
- **Docker Compose:** Comes bundled with Docker Desktop.
- **OpenAI API Key:** Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/elcaiseri/Evaluating-AI-Search-Visibility-for-Chime.git
	cd Evaluating-AI-Search-Visibility-for-Chime
	```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

	Create a `.env` file in the project root:

	```plaintext
	OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
	APP_TOKEN=your-app-token
	BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
	FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5500
	```

	*Note: Replace the placeholders with actual values. Do not commit this file to version control.*

3. **Prepare the Data:**

	Run the exploratory data analysis script to prepare the datasets:

	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python scraping/scraper.py
	```

4. **Build and Run the Containers:**

	Use Docker Compose to build and start the services:

	```sh
	docker-compose up --build
	```

	This will build both the frontend and backend containers and start them.

## Usage Instructions

**Access the Application:**

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5500`.

## API Documentation

The backend exposes a POST endpoint for querying datasets.

- **Endpoint:** `/query`
- **Method:** POST
- **Description:** Processes a user query and returns AI-generated insights.

**Error Handling:**

- If the request fails, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and an error message.

## Docker Instructions

### Building and Running the Containers

1. **Build the Docker Containers:**

	```sh
	docker-compose build
	```

2. **Start the Containers:**

	```sh
	docker-compose up
	```

3. **Run in Detached Mode (Optional):**

	```sh
	docker-compose up -d
	```

### Stopping the Containers

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Rebuilding After Code Changes

If you make changes to the code, rebuild the containers:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, consider using one of these services:

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- **Google Cloud Run**
- **Azure App Service**
- **Heroku**

### Deployment Checklist:

- Securely manage environment variables (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager).
- Configure CORS policies to allow frontend-backend communication.
- Use HTTPS in production to ensure secure data transmission.
